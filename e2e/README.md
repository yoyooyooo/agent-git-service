# E2E Tests

This folder contains lightweight end-to-end tests for `gh-server`.

E2E tests commonly use:
- shell scripts (`bash` + `curl`) for simple HTTP flows
- the repo's main language (Go here) for richer assertions and reuse
- Node/Python for API-driven integration suites

In this repo, we use **bash + curl + jq** for minimal dependencies and easy local debugging.

## Usage

Most scripts run against an existing server:

```bash
make run-bg
```

Some scripts are self-contained and build/start their own temporary server.

Run all e2e scripts:

```bash
make test-e2e
```

Run a single script:

```bash
make test-e2e SCRIPT=code-search-e2e
```

Notes:
- Scripts that require multiple users or tokens skip themselves when the needed
  token environment variables are absent.
- `code-search-e2e` requires TiDB running and tests code search indexing,
  query behavior, and qualifier handling.
- Self-contained TiDB scripts require a local TiDB-compatible endpoint, normally
  provided by `make test-setup`.

Override base URL (if not on port 80) or curl flags:

```bash
make test-e2e E2E_BASE_URL="https://github.localhost:8080"
```

Run the aggregate API performance benchmark against any environment:

```bash
E2E_TOKEN="$TOKEN" make test-e2e SCRIPT=benchmark/client-aggregate-performance E2E_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
E2E_TOKEN="$TOKEN" make test-e2e SCRIPT=benchmark/client-aggregate-performance E2E_BASE_URL="https://github.example.com"
```

Optional benchmark inputs:
- `E2E_PERF_REPO=owner/repo` chooses the repository target. Otherwise the first visible repo is used.
- `E2E_PERF_ORG=org` chooses the org management target. Otherwise the first visible org is used.
- `E2E_PERF_ISSUE_NUMBER=123` chooses the issue thread target. Otherwise the first issue in the repo is used.
- `E2E_PERF_WIKI_SLUGS=home,guides/setup` chooses wiki pages for batch comparison. Otherwise the first wiki pages are discovered.
- `E2E_PERF_ITERATIONS=10` changes measured iterations.
