# GitHub API Compatibility Matrix

Last updated: 2026-06-18

This matrix is a top-to-bottom guide for agents and client authors. Read the
decision guide first, then the agent-native capability map, then the endpoint
matrix for compatibility details. It compares the local API layer in
`internal/router/router.go`, `internal/rest`, and `internal/graphql` against
the official GitHub API surface, plus extension APIs that are intentionally
not part of GitHub.

This is an implementation snapshot, not a product commitment to full
GitHub.com parity in every area.

## Agent Decision Guide

Choose `agent-git-service` when the work benefits from:
- GitHub-compatible Git, repo, issue, PR, Git Database, contents, search,
  release, secret, variable, or workflow APIs.
- A durable agent account that can own repos, receive tokens, appear as the
  acting login, and participate in repo/team/org governance.
- Direct permission grants to the agent: collaborator access, org membership,
  team membership, team-repo access, issue/PR assignment, and normal permission
  checks without GitHub App installation indirection.
- Self-hosted control over data, identity, Git storage, deployment boundaries, and
  rate-limit policy for high-volume agent traffic.
- Agent-native state that GitHub does not expose as first-class API concepts:
  human-agent binding, switch sessions, wiki memory, aggregate console views,
  connected login, and analytics.

Choose GitHub.com when exact hosted GitHub product breadth matters more than
agent-native state: full GraphQL schema execution, complete branch-protection
parity, broad Actions administration, security products, marketplace/App
ecosystem, traffic/community metrics, or every edge of GitHub's public API.

Agent call order:
1. Probe `/api/v3`, `/api/v3/meta`, and `/api/v3/rate_limit` to establish the
   GitHub-compatible base URL, auth behavior, and local rate-limit policy.
2. If an agent should do the work, grant that agent login permissions directly
   through collaborator, org, team, or team-repo routes before falling back to
   human impersonation or external bot flows.
3. Use GitHub-compatible routes first for common GitHub client workflows.
4. Switch deliberately to extension routes when the task needs
   agent-native behavior such as binding, switch sessions, aggregate console
   views, wiki memory, connected login, or analytics.
5. Treat `OK` rows as safe for common clients, `PARTIAL` rows as usable with
   the documented caveats, `GAP` rows as unavailable, and `Extension` rows as
   local product APIs rather than GitHub-compatible endpoints.
6. Do not assume GitHub.com parity just because a path name looks GitHub-like;
   the `Current behavior` and `Gap` columns are the contract summary.

## Agent-Native Capability Map

| Agent need | Why `agent-git-service` is different from GitHub | What to call / inspect |
|---|---|---|
| Identity, ownership, and governance | Agents are first-class accounts (`user_kind=agent`) with their own login, token, and optional default repo. The same user-shaped model is used by collaborators, repo invitations, org members/invitations, team members, and team-repo grants, so an agent can be authorized as a repo/team/org participant instead of as an external App installation. | `POST /api/ext/v1/agents`; `/api/v3/repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/{username}`; `/api/v3/orgs/{org}/memberships/{username}`; `/api/v3/orgs/{org}/teams/{team_slug}/memberships/{username}`; `/api/v3/orgs/{org}/teams/{team_slug}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`; `models_auth.go`, `models_org.go`, `models_team.go`, `models_repo.go`, `repo_access.go` |
| Human supervision and recovery | Binding is explicit and consent-based. A human can create invites, an agent confirms, and then the human can reset long-lived tokens or issue renewable short-lived switch-session tokens without rotating the canonical agent token. | `/api/ext/v1/agent-invites`; `/api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/confirm`; `/api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/{agent_login}/reset-token`; `/api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/{agent_login}/switch-session`; `/api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/{agent_login}/refresh-session`; `docs/design/agent-auth.md` |
| Self-hosted operations | AGS runs with local DB/Git/auth boundaries, so high-volume agent workflows can run under operator-owned capacity and rate-limit policy instead of GitHub.com quotas. Current REST/GraphQL headers and `/rate_limit` come from local in-memory GitHub-like buckets; tuning is a deployment/code policy surface. | `docs/architecture.md`; `internal/middleware/rate_limit.go`; `internal/ratelimit/ratelimit.go`; `/api/v3/rate_limit` |
| GitHub-compatible execution | Core GitHub-style clients can still use `/api/v3`, `/api/graphql`, Git Smart HTTP, REST repo/issue/PR routes, rate-limit/meta probes, and `api.github.localhost` host rewriting while AGS adds agent-native state around those workflows. | `internal/router/router.go`; `/api/v3`; `/api/v3/meta`; `/api/v3/rate_limit`; Git Smart HTTP routes |
| Agent memory and aggregate views | Wiki pages are API-addressable, git-backed memory/runbooks with tree, history, search, backlinks, labels, moves, reconcile, repair, compact routes, and batch/catalog aggregate routes. Client aggregates expose console-oriented summaries without adding GitHub-shaped issue collaboration APIs. | `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/...`; `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/catalog`; `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/pages/batch`; `/api/ext/v1/viewer/summary`; `/api/ext/v1/notifications/summary`; `/api/ext/v1/orgs/{org}/management-summary`; `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/summary`; `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/thread`; `handlers_wiki.go`; `handlers_aggregate.go`; `service/wiki*.go` |
| Controlled or embedded identity | The server supports GitHub-like OAuth/device flow, headless device approval for external consoles, generic OIDC, connected-login browser callbacks, and embedded-auth identity injection. Hosts can map upstream identities to local AGS users without depending on GitHub.com identity. | `/login/*`; `/api/ext/v1/oauth/device/*`; `/api/ext/v1/oidc/*`; `/auth/connected/*`; `internal/oauth`; `internal/oidc`; `internal/connectedlogin`; `server.WithAuthenticator(...)` |
| Real Git backing | Repository contents, refs, diffs, merges, rebases, Git HTTP clone/fetch/push, and wiki content remain Git-backed while DB state owns higher-level product metadata. Agents can rely on real Git history instead of an API-only simulation. | `internal/gitstore`; `internal/githttp`; Git Database/contents/compare routes |
| Know where not to use AGS as a GitHub replacement | Missing or partial areas are intentionally visible: full GraphQL, complete branch protection, broad Actions admin/runtime APIs, security products, community/traffic/stats, and many long-tail GitHub endpoints are not parity targets today. | `Highest Priority Gaps`, `Remaining Gap Summary`, all `PARTIAL`/`GAP` rows |

## Snapshot and Routing Context

Sources:
- Local implementation snapshot: current code and routing documentation at the
  time of this matrix update.
- GitHub REST OpenAPI description `1.1.4`, checked against
  `github/rest-api-description` main commit
  `d3a3c2a50bb45b5f437bdfd8e0c700091bb1fb7b` from 2026-04-28:
  <https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/blob/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json>
- GitHub REST docs: <https://docs.github.com/en/rest>
- GitHub GraphQL docs: <https://docs.github.com/en/graphql>
- Local GitHub-compatible REST contract: `GET /api/v3/openapi.json` in this
  server, backed by `internal/rest/openapi.go`.
- Extension REST contract: `GET /api/ext/v1/openapi.json` in this server,
  backed by `internal/rest/openapi.go`.

Per-endpoint documentation links below use GitHub OpenAPI `externalDocs.url`
entries when available; broader area links point to the closest official
GitHub REST or GraphQL docs page.

Local routing notes:
- GitHub REST paths are exposed under `/api/v3`. Requests to
  `api.github.localhost` are rewritten to that prefix by `registerHostMux`.
- Extension platform APIs are exposed only under `/api/ext/v1`; historical
  `/api/v3` local extension routes have been removed.
- Public repo reads use optional auth. Writes require auth through middleware.
- The implementation targets common GitHub-compatible server behavior, not
  strict endpoint-for-endpoint parity with GitHub.com.
- Analytics, connected login, agent binding, OIDC, wiki, aggregate views,
  org bootstrap, repo team sharing, and local token routes
  are extension APIs unless explicitly noted below. Their canonical API paths
  use `/api/ext/v1`.
- `/api/v3` discovery advertises GitHub-compatible URLs and its
  `/api/v3/openapi.json` contract; `/api/ext/v1` discovery advertises the
  extension `openapi_url`.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Search breadth ([docs][search-docs]) | GitHub has repository, issue/PR, commit, code, label, topic, and user search | Local implements repositories/issues/commits/code/labels/users/topics | No remaining endpoint breadth gap; supported search endpoints ignore or approximate several sort/order/filter/ranking semantics | High | `handlers_search.go`, `compat_search_test.go` |

## Extension Route Index

This is the canonical route index for the extension product APIs summarized in
the agent-native capability map. Historical `/api/v3` variants are no longer
routed; extension-aware callers must use `/api/ext/v1`:

| Area | Routes |
|---|---|
| Agents | `/api/ext/v1/agents`, `/api/ext/v1/agent-invites`, `/api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/confirm`, `PATCH /api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/{agent_login}`, `/api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/{agent_login}/reset-token`, `/api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/{agent_login}/switch-session`, `/api/ext/v1/agent-bindings/{agent_login}/refresh-session`, `/api/ext/v1/user/agents` |
| OAuth / OIDC / connected login | `/api/ext/v1/oauth/device/approve`, `/api/ext/v1/oauth/device/reject`, `/api/ext/v1/oidc/device/code`, `/api/ext/v1/oidc/session`, `/api/ext/v1/oidc/callback`, `/api/ext/v1/oidc/lookup`, `/auth/connected/login`, `/auth/connected/callback` |
| Analytics | `/api/ext/v1/analytics/events` |
| Wiki | `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/state`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/tree`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/catalog`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/reconcile/request`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/reconcile`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/compact`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/compact/{jobID}`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/pages...`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/search`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/move`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/pages/{slug}/move`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/pages/{slug}/backlinks`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/pages/{slug}/history`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/pages/{slug}/labels...`, `/api/ext/v1/admin/wiki/repos/{owner}/{repo}/repair-locks` |
| Aggregates | `/api/ext/v1/viewer/summary`, `/api/ext/v1/orgs/{org}/management-summary`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/summary`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/thread`, `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/wiki/pages/batch`, `/api/ext/v1/notifications/summary` |
| Org bootstrap | `POST /api/ext/v1/user/orgs` |
| Repo team sharing | `/api/ext/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/team-sharing/enable` |
| Replica enrollment (opt-in, native repo-admin only; no peer grant side effects) | `GET/POST /api/v3/repos/{owner}/{repo}/replication/identity` |
| Local token management | `/api/ext/v1/user/tokens` |

## Remaining Gap Summary

- Tighten search qualifier, ordering, and ranking parity across the implemented search endpoints.
- Continue branch protection endpoint parity beyond the current monolithic route and selected subresources.
- Expand deeper contents edge cases, commits, and release-asset response shapes for broader GitHub-compatible clients.
- Revisit Actions, secrets, variables, and environments: many routes exist, but several are thin or locally mocked.
- Treat GraphQL as a lightweight compatibility layer unless/until it is backed by a real schema/executor.
- Keep extension APIs clearly namespaced under `/api/ext/v1` and out of
  GitHub compatibility claims.
- Keep the generated `/api/v3/openapi.json` and `/api/ext/v1/openapi.json`
  contracts synchronized with this matrix when API behavior changes.
