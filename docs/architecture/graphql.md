# GraphQL API — Component Reference

## Purpose

`internal/graphql` implements the GitHub GraphQL API v4 surface.
It parses incoming GraphQL requests, routes them to query or mutation handlers, builds GraphQL-specific response shapes, and filters responses to the requested field selection set.

The field-filtering behavior is critical for strict GraphQL clients, including `gh` CLI: unexpected fields can break strict unmarshaling.

For the full system overview see [docs/architecture.md](../architecture.md).
Core invariant: `agent-git-service` is Git-backed; see [architecture.md § Purpose](../architecture.md#purpose).

## Scope

Owns:

- GraphQL request parsing (query string, operation name, variables)
- query and mutation routing via AST field detection
- building GraphQL-specific response shapes (distinct from REST transforms)
- field filtering against the requested selection set
- fragment expansion for nested filtering

Does not own:

- business rules or domain validation (belongs to `service`)
- REST response shapes (belongs to `rest/transform`)
- route registration (belongs to `router`)

## Key Entry Points

## Main Flows

### Query Pipeline

```
POST /api/graphql { query, variables, operationName }
  → handler.go: Handler()
  → parseQuery(query)
      → gqlparser AST → field map + fragment definitions + __type introspections
  → routeQuery(ctx, req, ast)
      → AST field checks (astHas, astChild) to determine query type
      → regex fallback for batched aliased repository queries
      → operation name fallback for CLI-specific queries
      → dispatch to doRepository, doIssues, doPRs, doSearch, doNode, etc.
  → resolver builds full response map
  → filterMap(response, ast, fragments)
      → recursively prune to only requested fields
      → expand fragment spreads
  → respond.JSON(w, 200, {"data": filtered})
```

### Mutation Pipeline

```
POST /api/graphql { query: "mutation { createIssue(...) { issue { id } } }", variables }
  → Handler() detects "mutation" keyword
  → parseQuery → AST
  → routeMutation(ctx, req, ast)
      → compound conditions for XOR mutations (archive/unarchive)
      → lookup table: mutation name → handler function
  → handler: extract input vars → call service → build shape → wrap("createIssue", result)
  → filterMap → respond
```

### Field Filtering

```
Request: repository { issues { nodes { id title } } }
  → AST: {repository: {issues: {nodes: {id: true, title: true}}}}
  → resolver returns full issue objects (id, title, body, author, labels, ...)
  → filterMap strips everything except id and title at each nesting level
  → clients such as gh CLI receive only requested fields, strict unmarshaling succeeds
```

Without filtering, strict GraphQL clients such as `gh` CLI can reject the response.

### Delegated PR Actor Projection

A `PullRequest` exposes optional `agsActor` and `delegatedBy` fields. The shape
uses GraphQL camelCase equivalents of the REST extension: `workspaceId`,
`agentId`, `agentName`, `taskId`, optional `runId`/`issueId`/`issueKey`,
`sessionId`, `sessionState`, `sessionCreatedAt`, `targetInstance`, and
`displayName`. `delegatedBy` separates `principal` from an optional `human` and
includes `bindingSource`.

The ordinary `author` remains the stable AGS principal. Durable PRs return
`agsActor: null` and `delegatedBy: null`. These fields are included in
`PullRequest` type introspection and pass through normal field filtering. No
credential, assertion/JTI, hash/fingerprint, or policy-snapshot data is part of
the GraphQL shape.

### PR with Branch Comparison

```
query { repository { pullRequest(number: N) { ... baseRef { compare(headRef: ...) { ... } } } } }
  → doPRSingle()
  → detect baseRef.compare in AST
  → Svc.Git.HeadSHA(ctx, repo, base) + Svc.Git.HeadSHA(ctx, repo, head)
  → Svc.Git.Compare(ctx, repo, baseSHA, headSHA)
  → embed comparison data in PR response shape
```

## Invariants and Design Constraints

- **Field filtering is mandatory.** Every GraphQL response passes through `filterMap` before being sent to the client. This ensures compatibility with strict GraphQL client libraries.
- **GraphQL builds its own response shapes.** The `gql_shapes_*.go` files are independent of `rest/transform`. REST and GraphQL contracts differ, and sharing shape code would create coupling. Delegated actor facts come from the shared service attribution projection, then receive GraphQL-specific camelCase shaping.
- **GraphQL uses `rest/respond` for HTTP writing only.** This is acceptable because GraphQL builds its own data payloads; `rest/respond` only handles the HTTP JSON serialization.
- **Repository authorization flows through `service.HasRepoAccess`.** `viewerPermission` now reports the richer `READ`/`TRIAGE`/`WRITE`/`MAINTAIN`/`ADMIN` vocabulary rather than a three-level model.
- **Accepted `Svc.Git` coupling.** Several resolvers call `s.Svc.Git.*` directly for compare, mergeability, branch SHA lookup, repo detail, and revert operations. This is documented as accepted current coupling.
- **Accepted `Svc.DB` coupling in Dependabot mutations.** `gql_mut_dependabot.go` queries `s.Svc.DB` directly to resolve alert records by ID. This is current technical debt that bypasses the intended persistence ownership.
- **`Server` depends on concrete `*service.Service`.** The GraphQL server receives the full service struct, not a narrow interface. This is acceptable for now given the large resolver surface.
- **Delegated GraphQL is closed to one numbered PR query.** Before resolver dispatch, auth middleware admits an `access_grant_transport` Session only for `pr.read` and only when a bounded JSON body contains exactly one `PullRequestByNumber` query shaped as `repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo) { pullRequest(number:$pr_number) { ... } }`. The owner/repository and positive PR number must equal the Session repository and `pull_request_number` constraint. Mutations, subscriptions, fragments, alternate aliases, noncanonical variable definitions, extra variables or top-level resources, malformed/oversized bodies, and mismatched repository/PR facts fail closed and are audited as surface denials. Durable tokens retain the normal GraphQL surface.

## Extension and Change Guidance

**Adding a new query:**

1. Add a `do*` handler method to `*Server` in the appropriate `gql_query_*.go` file.
2. Add AST detection logic in `handler_query.go` `routeQuery()` (use `astHas` or `astChild`).
3. Build the response shape in the corresponding `gql_shapes_*.go` file.
4. The handler should call service methods, build the shape, and return via `wrap("fieldName", data)`.
5. Field filtering is automatic — no additional work needed.

**Adding a new mutation:**

1. Add a `do*` handler method in the appropriate `gql_mut_*.go` file.
2. Register it in the mutation dispatch table in `handler.go` `routeMutation()`.
3. Extract input variables via `inputMap(req)` and type-safe helpers (`strFrom`, `intVar`).
4. Call service methods, build the response shape, and return via `wrap`.

**Common patterns:**

- `resolveRepo(req)` extracts owner/name from variables.
- `parseNodeID(id)` converts Base64 Relay-style node IDs to DB IDs.
- `queryHasAny(req.Query, "fieldName")` is a fast heuristic to prevent N+1 queries (checks raw query string before doing expensive lookups).
- Batched alias mutations (e.g., `add_000`, `delete_001`) are handled by iterating over request aliases.

## Auto-Merge Contract

- `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` and `disablePullRequestAutoMerge` call `service.SetPRAutoMerge`, so GraphQL enforces authentication, repository write access, and the repository-level `autoMergeAllowed` flag.
- The enable mutation persists `mergeMethod`, `commitHeadline`, `commitBody`, `authorEmail`, and `expectedHeadOid` for later execution.
- Queued auto-merge is executed asynchronously when workflow runs or commit statuses update the PR head SHA and the shared service merge policy passes.
- GraphQL does not expose a branch-protection mutation or `bypassPullRequestAllowances` equivalent today. Branch-protection bypass configuration is available only through the REST branch-protection payload.
